We, of course, condemn travelling during COVID but this is website is meant for when restrictions are lifted and people are able to travel again even with COVID still around.
This is why we made this site. We want people to make informed decisions on travel, locally and internationally, by supplying them with covid and vaccination data as well as destinations
and activities around Calgary for those local travellers. This is also a great platform for promoting local businesses, promotions and other activities for families to enjoy. The COVID data is updated through the 
AHS website. The international COVID data is updated through the CDC.
